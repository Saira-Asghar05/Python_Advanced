    "- Class: A blueprint consisting of methods and attributes.\n",
    "- Object: An instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small   dog, or a blue shirt. However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.\n",
    "- Attribute: A descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific   values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.\n",
    "- Method: An action that a class or object could take.\n",
    "- OOP: A commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: One of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine        functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details, much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- In English, you might hear an attribute described as property, description, feature, quality, trait, or characteristic. All of these are saying the same thing.\n",
